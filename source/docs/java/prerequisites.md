## Getting Started

This tutorial will start off with the basics of the [Java Discord API (JDA)](https://github.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JDA) wrapper. Building a solid foundation on the basics of JDA will allow us to build more complex projects as the tutorial progresses.

In this tutorial, we will be using the [IntelliJ IDEA IDE](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/), created by JetBrains _(community edition will suffice)_.

:::caution
This tutorial assumes you have a basic understanding of Object Oriented Programming (OOP) and the fundamentals of the Java programming language down. You must also have the [Java Development Kit (JDK)](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/javase-jdk8-downloads.html) 8+ installed.
